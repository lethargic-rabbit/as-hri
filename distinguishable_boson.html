            <h2>A central limit theorem for partially distinguishable bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Marco Robbio, Michael G. Jabbour, Leonardo Novo, Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for understanding how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of the subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of freedom. While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose experimental imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.</p>

            <h2>Boson bunching is not maximized by indistinguishable particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benoit Seron, Leonardo Novo & Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Boson bunching is among the most remarkable features of quantum physics. A celebrated example in optics is the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beamsplitter or are reflected. This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. Hence, it is generally admitted—and experimentally verified—that bunching vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, for example, when they occupy distinct time bins or have different polarizations. Here we disprove this alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability and bunching by exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a family of optical circuits such that the bunching of photons into two modes can be substantially boosted by making them partially distinguishable via an appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a seven-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon within reach of current photonic technology. This unexpected behaviour questions our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishability and Many-Particle Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Adrian J. Menssen, Alex E. Jones, Benjamin J. Metcalf, Malte C. Tichy, Stefanie Barz, W. Steven Kolthammer, and Ian A. Walmsley</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum interference of two independent particles in pure quantum states is fully described by the particles’ distinguishability: the closer the particles are to being identical, the higher the degree of quantum interference. When more than two particles are involved, the situation becomes more complex and interference capability extends beyond pairwise distinguishability, taking on a surprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using three photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is not sufficient to fully describe the photons’ behavior in a scattering process, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are able to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by generating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fiber tritter. Using multiple degrees of freedom—temporal delays and polarization—we isolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment disproves the view that pairwise two-photon distinguishability uniquely determines the degree of nonclassical many-particle interference.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishability and mixedness in quantum interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Alex E. Jones, Shreya Kumar, Simone D'Aurelio, Matthias Bayerbach, Adrian J. Menssen and Stefanie Barz</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the impact of distinguishability and mixedness, two fundamental properties of quantum states, on quantum interference. We show that these can influence the interference of multiple particles in different ways, leading to effects that cannot be observed in the interference of two particles alone. This is demonstrated experimentally by interfering three independent photons in pure and mixed states and observing their different multiphoton interference, despite exhibiting the same two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In addition to its fundamental relevance, our observation has important implications for quantum technologies relying on photon interference.</p>

            <h2>Two-photon interference: the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Frédéric Bouchard, Alicia Sit, Yingwen Zhang, Robert Fickler, Filippo M Miatto, Yuan Yao, Fabio Sciarrino and Ebrahim Karimi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 30 years ago, two-photon interference was observed, marking the beginning of a new quantum era. Indeed, two-photon interference has no classical analogue, giving it a distinct advantage for a range of applications. The peculiarities of quantum physics may now be used to our advantage to outperform classical computations, securely communicate information, simulate highly complex physical systems and increase the sensitivity of precise measurements. This separation from classical to quantum physics has motivated physicists to study two-particle interference for both fermionic and bosonic quantum objects. So far, two-particle interference has been observed with massive particles, among others, such as electrons and atoms, in addition to plasmons, demonstrating the extent of this effect to larger and more complex quantum systems. A wide array of novel applications to this quantum effect is to be expected in the future. This review will thus cover the progress and applications of two-photon (two-particle) interference over the last three decades.</p>

            <h2>MULTI-PHOTON INTERFERENCE AND TEMPORAL DISTINGUISHABILITY OF PHOTONS</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Z. Y. OU</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A number of recent interference experiments involving multiple photons are reviewed. These experiments include generalized photon bunching effects, generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effects and multi-photon interferometry for demonstrations of multi-photon de Broglie wavelength. The multi-photon states used in these experiments are from two pairs of photons in parametric down-conversion. We find that the size of the interference effect in these experiments, characterized by the visibility of the interference pattern, is governed by the degree of distinguishability among different pairs of photons. Based on this discovery, we generalize the concept of multi-photon temporal distinguishability and relate it to a number of multi-photon interference effects. Finally, we make an attempt to interpret the coherence theory by multi-photon interference via the concept of temporal distinguishability of photons.</p>

            <h2>Partial indistinguishability theory for multiphoton experiments in multiport devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> V. S. Shchesnovich</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We generalize an approach for description of multiphoton experiments with multiport unitary linear optical devices, started in Phys. Rev. A 89, 022333 (2014) with single photons in mixed spectral states, to arbitrary (multiphoton) input and arbitrary photon detectors. We show that output probabilities are always given in terms of the matrix permanents of the Hadamard product of a matrix built from the network matrix and matrices built from the spectral state of photons and spectral sensitivities of detectors. Moreover, in the case of input with up to one photon per mode, the output probabilities are given by a sum (or integral) with each term being the absolute value squared of such a matrix permanent. We conjecture that, for an arbitrary multiphoton input, zero output probability of an output configuration is always the result of an exact cancellation of quantum transition amplitudes of completely indistinguishable photons (a subset of all input photons) and, moreover, is independent of coherence between only partially indistinguishable photons. The conjecture is supported by examples. Furthermore, we propose a measure of partial indistinguishability of photons which generalizes Mandel's observation, and find the law of degradation of quantum coherence in a realistic boson-sampling device with increase of the total number of photons and/or their “classicality parameter.”</p>

            <h2>Sampling of partially distinguishable bosons and the relation to the multidimensional permanent</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Malte C. Tichy</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The collective interference of partially distinguishable bosons in multimode networks is studied via double-sided Feynman diagrams. The probability for many-body scattering events becomes a multidimensional tensor permanent, which interpolates between distinguishable particles and identical bosons and easily extends to mixed initial states. The permanent of the distinguishability matrix, composed of all mutual scalar products of the single-particle mode functions, emerges as a natural measure for the degree of interference: It yields a bound on the difference between event probabilities for partially distinguishable bosons and the idealized species and exactly quantifies the degree of bosonic bunching.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing temporal distinguishability of an 𝑁-photon state by a generalized photon bunching effect with multiphoton interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The complementarity principle of quantum mechanics relates qualitatively the visibility of quantum interference with path indistinguishability. A quantitative study was recently presented [Z. Y. Ou, Phys. Rev. A 74, 063808 (2006)]. Following the formalism of this study, we investigate another scheme for characterizing quantitatively the degree of temporal distinguishability of an 𝑁-photon state, based on constructive quantum interference between an 𝑁-photon and a single-photon state. This scheme is related to a generalized photon bunching effect in the form of a “bump,” in contrast to the “dip” for the destructive interference effect in the previous study. Generalization to other more complicated cases is straightforward and is much simpler than for the scheme of destructive interference in the previous study. A degree of (in)distinguishability is defined and can be determined experimentally by the measurement of the size of the constructive multiphoton interference effect.</p>
