            <h2>A central limit theorem for partially distinguishable bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Marco Robbio, Michael G. Jabbour, Leonardo Novo, Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for understanding how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of the subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of freedom. While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose experimental imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.</p>

            <h2>Boson bunching is not maximized by indistinguishable particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benoit Seron, Leonardo Novo & Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Boson bunching is among the most remarkable features of quantum physics. A celebrated example in optics is the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beamsplitter or are reflected. This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. Hence, it is generally admitted—and experimentally verified—that bunching vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, for example, when they occupy distinct time bins or have different polarizations. Here we disprove this alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability and bunching by exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a family of optical circuits such that the bunching of photons into two modes can be substantially boosted by making them partially distinguishable via an appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a seven-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon within reach of current photonic technology. This unexpected behaviour questions our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishability and Many-Particle Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Adrian J. Menssen, Alex E. Jones, Benjamin J. Metcalf, Malte C. Tichy, Stefanie Barz, W. Steven Kolthammer, and Ian A. Walmsley</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum interference of two independent particles in pure quantum states is fully described by the particles’ distinguishability: the closer the particles are to being identical, the higher the degree of quantum interference. When more than two particles are involved, the situation becomes more complex and interference capability extends beyond pairwise distinguishability, taking on a surprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using three photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is not sufficient to fully describe the photons’ behavior in a scattering process, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are able to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by generating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fiber tritter. Using multiple degrees of freedom—temporal delays and polarization—we isolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment disproves the view that pairwise two-photon distinguishability uniquely determines the degree of nonclassical many-particle interference.</p>

            <h2>Distinguishability and mixedness in quantum interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Alex E. Jones, Shreya Kumar, Simone D'Aurelio, Matthias Bayerbach, Adrian J. Menssen and Stefanie Barz</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the impact of distinguishability and mixedness, two fundamental properties of quantum states, on quantum interference. We show that these can influence the interference of multiple particles in different ways, leading to effects that cannot be observed in the interference of two particles alone. This is demonstrated experimentally by interfering three independent photons in pure and mixed states and observing their different multiphoton interference, despite exhibiting the same two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In addition to its fundamental relevance, our observation has important implications for quantum technologies relying on photon interference.</p>

            <h2>Two-photon interference: the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Frédéric Bouchard, Alicia Sit, Yingwen Zhang, Robert Fickler, Filippo M Miatto, Yuan Yao, Fabio Sciarrino and Ebrahim Karimi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 30 years ago, two-photon interference was observed, marking the beginning of a new quantum era. Indeed, two-photon interference has no classical analogue, giving it a distinct advantage for a range of applications. The peculiarities of quantum physics may now be used to our advantage to outperform classical computations, securely communicate information, simulate highly complex physical systems and increase the sensitivity of precise measurements. This separation from classical to quantum physics has motivated physicists to study two-particle interference for both fermionic and bosonic quantum objects. So far, two-particle interference has been observed with massive particles, among others, such as electrons and atoms, in addition to plasmons, demonstrating the extent of this effect to larger and more complex quantum systems. A wide array of novel applications to this quantum effect is to be expected in the future. This review will thus cover the progress and applications of two-photon (two-particle) interference over the last three decades.</p>
