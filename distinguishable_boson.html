            <h2>A central limit theorem for partially distinguishable bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Marco Robbio, Michael G. Jabbour, Leonardo Novo, Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The quantum central limit theorem derived by Cushen and Hudson provides the foundations for understanding how subsystems of large bosonic systems evolving unitarily do reach equilibrium. It finds important applications in the context of quantum interferometry, for example, with photons. A practical feature of current photonic experiments, however, is that photons carry their own internal degrees of freedom pertaining to, e.g., the polarization or spatiotemporal mode they occupy, which makes them partially distinguishable. The ensuing deviation from ideal indistinguishability is well known to have observable consequences, for example in relation with boson bunching, but an understanding of its role in bosonic equilibration phenomena is still missing. Here, we generalize the Cushen-Hudson quantum central limit theorem to encompass scenarios with partial distinguishability, implying an asymptotic convergence of the subsystem's reduced state towards a multimode Gaussian state defined over the internal degrees of freedom. While these asymptotic internal states may not be directly accessible, we show that particle number distributions carry important signatures of distinguishability, which may be used to diagnose experimental imperfections in large boson sampling experiments.</p>

            <h2>Sampling of partially distinguishable bosons and the relation to the multidimensional permanent</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Malte C. Tichy</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The collective interference of partially distinguishable bosons in multimode networks is studied via double-sided Feynman diagrams. The probability for many-body scattering events becomes a multidimensional tensor permanent, which interpolates between distinguishable particles and identical bosons and easily extends to mixed initial states. The permanent of the distinguishability matrix, composed of all mutual scalar products of the single-particle mode functions, emerges as a natural measure for the degree of interference: It yields a bound on the difference between event probabilities for partially distinguishable bosons and the idealized species and exactly quantifies the degree of bosonic bunching.</p>

            <h2>Boson bunching is not maximized by indistinguishable particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benoit Seron, Leonardo Novo & Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Boson bunching is among the most remarkable features of quantum physics. A celebrated example in optics is the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beamsplitter or are reflected. This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. Hence, it is generally admitted—and experimentally verified—that bunching vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, for example, when they occupy distinct time bins or have different polarizations. Here we disprove this alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability and bunching by exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a family of optical circuits such that the bunching of photons into two modes can be substantially boosted by making them partially distinguishable via an appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a seven-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon within reach of current photonic technology. This unexpected behaviour questions our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Adrian J. Menssen, Alex E. Jones, Benjamin J. Metcalf, Malte C. Tichy, Stefanie Barz, W. Steven Kolthammer, and Ian A. Walmsley</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum interference of two independent particles in pure quantum states is fully described by the particles’ distinguishability: the closer the particles are to being identical, the higher the degree of quantum interference. When more than two particles are involved, the situation becomes more complex and interference capability extends beyond pairwise distinguishability, taking on a surprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using three photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is not sufficient to fully describe the photons’ behavior in a scattering process, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are able to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by generating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fiber tritter. Using multiple degrees of freedom—temporal delays and polarization—we isolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment disproves the view that pairwise two-photon distinguishability uniquely determines the degree of nonclassical many-particle interference.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the impact of distinguishability and mixedness, two fundamental properties of quantum states, on quantum interference. We show that these can influence the interference of multiple particles in different ways, leading to effects that cannot be observed in the interference of two particles alone. This is demonstrated experimentally by interfering three independent photons in pure and mixed states and observing their different multiphoton interference, despite exhibiting the same two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. In addition to its fundamental relevance, our observation has important implications for quantum technologies relying on photon interference.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nearly 30 years ago, two-photon interference was observed, marking the beginning of a new quantum era. Indeed, two-photon interference has no classical analogue, giving it a distinct advantage for a range of applications. The peculiarities of quantum physics may now be used to our advantage to outperform classical computations, securely communicate information, simulate highly complex physical systems and increase the sensitivity of precise measurements. This separation from classical to quantum physics has motivated physicists to study two-particle interference for both fermionic and bosonic quantum objects. So far, two-particle interference has been observed with massive particles, among others, such as electrons and atoms, in addition to plasmons, demonstrating the extent of this effect to larger and more complex quantum systems. A wide array of novel applications to this quantum effect is to be expected in the future. This review will thus cover the progress and applications of two-photon (two-particle) interference over the last three decades.</p>

            <h2>MULTI-PHOTON INTERFERENCE AND TEMPORAL DISTINGUISHABILITY OF PHOTONS</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Z. Y. OU</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A number of recent interference experiments involving multiple photons are reviewed. These experiments include generalized photon bunching effects, generalized Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effects and multi-photon interferometry for demonstrations of multi-photon de Broglie wavelength. The multi-photon states used in these experiments are from two pairs of photons in parametric down-conversion. We find that the size of the interference effect in these experiments, characterized by the visibility of the interference pattern, is governed by the degree of distinguishability among different pairs of photons. Based on this discovery, we generalize the concept of multi-photon temporal distinguishability and relate it to a number of multi-photon interference effects. Finally, we make an attempt to interpret the coherence theory by multi-photon interference via the concept of temporal distinguishability of photons.</p>

            <h2>Partial indistinguishability theory for multiphoton experiments in multiport devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> V. S. Shchesnovich</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We generalize an approach for description of multiphoton experiments with multiport unitary linear optical devices, started in Phys. Rev. A 89, 022333 (2014) with single photons in mixed spectral states, to arbitrary (multiphoton) input and arbitrary photon detectors. We show that output probabilities are always given in terms of the matrix permanents of the Hadamard product of a matrix built from the network matrix and matrices built from the spectral state of photons and spectral sensitivities of detectors. Moreover, in the case of input with up to one photon per mode, the output probabilities are given by a sum (or integral) with each term being the absolute value squared of such a matrix permanent. We conjecture that, for an arbitrary multiphoton input, zero output probability of an output configuration is always the result of an exact cancellation of quantum transition amplitudes of completely indistinguishable photons (a subset of all input photons) and, moreover, is independent of coherence between only partially indistinguishable photons. The conjecture is supported by examples. Furthermore, we propose a measure of partial indistinguishability of photons which generalizes Mandel's observation, and find the law of degradation of quantum coherence in a realistic boson-sampling device with increase of the total number of photons and/or their “classicality parameter.”</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Z. Y. Ou</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The complementarity principle of quantum mechanics relates qualitatively the visibility of quantum interference with path indistinguishability. A quantitative study was recently presented [Z. Y. Ou, Phys. Rev. A 74, 063808 (2006)]. Following the formalism of this study, we investigate another scheme for characterizing quantitatively the degree of temporal distinguishability of an 𝑁-photon state, based on constructive quantum interference between an 𝑁-photon and a single-photon state. This scheme is related to a generalized photon bunching effect in the form of a “bump,” in contrast to the “dip” for the destructive interference effect in the previous study. Generalization to other more complicated cases is straightforward and is much simpler than for the scheme of destructive interference in the previous study. A degree of (in)distinguishability is defined and can be determined experimentally by the measurement of the size of the constructive multiphoton interference effect.</p>

            <h2>Interference of Identical Particles from Entanglement to Boson-Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Malte C. Tichy</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Progress in the reliable preparation, coherent propagation and efficient detection of many-body states has recently brought collective quantum phenomena of many identical particles into the spotlight. This tutorial introduces the physics of many-boson and many-fermion interference required for the description of current experiments and for the understanding of novel approaches to quantum computing.
The field is motivated via the two-particle case, for which the uncorrelated, classical dynamics of distinguishable particles is compared to the quantum behaviour of identical bosons and fermions. Bunching of bosons is opposed to anti-bunching of fermions, while both species constitute equivalent sources of bipartite two-level entanglement. The realms of indistinguishable and distinguishable particles are connected by a monotonic transition, on a scale defined by the coherence length of the interfering particles.
As we move to larger systems, any attempt to understand many particles via the two-particle paradigm fails: In contrast to two-particle bunching and anti-bunching, the very same signatures can be exhibited by bosons and fermions, and coherent effects dominate over statistical behaviour. The simulation of many-boson interference, termed Boson-Sampling, entails a qualitatively superior computational complexity when compared to fermions. The hierarchy between bosons and fermions also characterises multipartite entanglement generation, for which bosons again clearly outmatch fermions. Finally, the quantum-to-classical transition between many indistinguishable and many distinguishable particles features non-monotonic structures. While the same physical principles govern small and large systems, the deployment of the intrinsic complexity of collective many-body interference makes more particles behave differently.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We obtain coincidence rates for passive optical interferometry by exploiting the permutational symmetries of partially distinguishable input photons, and our approach elucidates qualitative features of multi-photon coincidence landscapes. We treat the interferometer input as a product state of any number of photons in each input mode with photons distinguished by their arrival time. Detectors at the output of the interferometer count photons from each output mode over a long integration time. We generalize and prove the claim of Tillmann et al. [Phys. Rev. X 5 041015 (2015)] that coincidence rates can be elegantly expressed in terms of immanants. Immanants are functions of matrices that exhibit permutational symmetries and the immanants appearing in our coincidence-rate expressions share permutational symmetries with the input state. Our results are obtained by employing representation theory of the symmetric group to analyze systems of arbitrary number of photons in arbitrarily sized interferometers..</p>

Moreover, the statistical transition of the photon state was studied for partially distinguishable photons, and the results shows the that indistinguishability exhibits the same role as that observed in the generation of laser. The results will fill the gap between Bose--Einstein and Poisson statistics for photons, and a formula is presented for the study of multi-photon quantum information processes.</p>

However, all sensors must tolerate imperfections if they are to be practical. Here we show that photons with perfectly overlapped modes, which are therefore fully indistinguishable, are not required for quantum-enhanced measurement, and that partially-distinguishable photons do not have to be engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of distinguishability. We quantify the effect of distinguishability on quantum metrology experiments, and report results of an experiment to verify that two- and four-photon states containing partially-distinguishable photons can achieve quantum-enhanced sensitivity with low-visibility quantum interference. This demonstrates that sources producing photons with mixed spectral states can be readily utilized for quantum metrology..</p>

Practical quantum-enhanced interferometry is, however, vulnerable to imperfections such as partial distinguishability of interfering photons. Here we introduce a method where appropriate design of the modal structure of input photons can alleviate deleterious effects caused by another, experimentally inaccessible degree of freedom. This result is accompanied by a laboratory demonstration that a suitable choice of spatial modes combined with position-resolved coincidence detection restores entanglement-enhanced precision in the full operating range of a realistic two-photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, specifically around a point which otherwise does not even attain the shot-noise limit due to the presence of residual distinguishing information in the spectral degree of freedom. Our method highlights the potential of engineering multimode physical systems in metrologic applications..</p>

An upper bound on the trace distance to the ideal bosonic network is proven and also a bound on the difference between probabilities of an output configuration. Moreover, the upper bound on the trace distance is tight, provided that a physically transparent distinguishability conjecture is true. For a small distinguishability error it is shown that a realistic device with N bosons is at a constant trace distance to the ideal Boson Sampling under the O(N−1)-scaling of the mismatch of internal states of bosons..</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Peter P. Rohde</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Boson-sampling has attracted much interest as a simplified approach to implementing a subset of optical quantum computing. Boson-sampling requires indistinguishable photons, but far fewer of them than universal optical quantum computing architectures. In reality, photons are never indistinguishable, and exhibit a rich spectral structure. Here we consider the operation of boson-sampling with photons of arbitrary spectral structure and relate the sampling statistics of the device to matrix permanents. This sheds light on the computational complexity of different regimes of the photons' spectral characteristics, and provides very general results for the operation of linear optics interferometers in the presence of partially distinguishable photons. Our results apply to both the cases of spectrally resolving and non-spectrally resolving detectors..</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We use permutation-group methods plus SU(3) group-theoretic methods to determine the action of a three-channel passive optical interferometer on controllably delayed single-photon pulse inputs to each channel. Permutation-group techniques allow us to relate directly expressions for rates and, in particular, investigate symmetries in the coincidence landscape. These techniques extend the traditional Hong-Ou-Mandel effect analysis for two-channel interferometry to valleys and plateaus in three-channel interferometry. Our group-theoretic approach is intuitively appealing because the calculus of Wigner D functions partially accounts for permutational symmetries and directly reveals the connections among D functions, partial distinguishability, and immanants..</p>

            <h2>Detection efficiency for loophole-free Bell tests with entangled states affected by colored noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Gustavo Cañas, Johanna F. Barra, Esteban S. Gómez, Gustavo Lima, Fabio Sciarrino, Adan Cabello</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> .Loophole-free Bell tests for quantum nonlocality and long-distance secure communication require photodetection efficiencies beyond a threshold eta_{crit} that depends on the Bell inequality and the noise affecting the entangled state received by the distant parties. Most calculations of eta_{crit} assume that the noise is random and can be modeled as white noise. However, most sources suffer from colored noise. Indeed, since entangled states are usually created as a superposition of two possible deexcitation paths, a partial distinguishability between the two processes leads to the appearance of colored noise in the generated state. Recently, there was a proposal for a loophole-free Bell test [A. Cabello and F. Sciarrino, Phys. Rev. X 2, 021010 (2012)], where a specific colored noise appears as a consequence of the precertification of the photon's presence through single-photon spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Here we obtain eta_{crit}, the optimal quantum states, and the local settings for a loophole-free Bell test as a function of the amount of colored noise. We consider three bipartite Bell inequalities with n dichotomic settings: Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (n=2), I_{3322} (n=3), and A_5 (n=4), both for the case of symmetric efficiencies, corresponding to photon-photon Bell tests, and for the totally asymmetric case, corresponding to atom-photon Bell tests. Remarkably, in all these cases, eta_{crit} is robust against the colored noise. The present analysis can find application in any test of Bell inequalities in which the dominant noise is of the colored type.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Changhun Oh </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Noise is one of the main obstacles to realizing quantum devices that achieve a quantum computational advantage. A possible approach to minimize the noise effect is to employ shallow-depth quantum circuits since noise typically accumulates as circuit depth grows. In this work, we investigate the complexity of shallow-depth linear-optical circuits under the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability. By establishing a correspondence between a linear-optical circuit and a bipartite graph, we show that the effects of photon loss and partial distinguishability are equivalent to removing the corresponding vertices. Using this correspondence and percolation theory, we prove that for constant-depth linear-optical circuits with single photons, there is a threshold of loss (noise) rate above which the linear-optical systems can be decomposed into smaller systems with high probability, which enables us to simulate the systems efficiently. Consequently, our result implies that even in shallow-depth circuits where noise is not accumulated enough, its effect may be sufficiently significant to make them efficiently simulable using classical algorithms due to its entanglement structure constituted by shallow-depth circuits..</p>

            <h2>Enhanced bunching of nearly indistinguishable bosons</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Léo Pioge, Benoit Seron, Leonardo Novo, Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In multiphon interference processes, the commonly assumed direct link between boson bunching and particle indistinguishability has recently been challenged in Seron et al. [Nat. Photon. 17, 702 (2023)]. Exploiting the connection between optical interferometry and matrix permanents, it appeared that bunching effects may surprisingly be enhanced in some interferometers by preparing specific states of partially distinguishable photons. Interestingly, all the states giving rise to such an anomalous bunching were found to be far from the state of perfectly indistinguishable particles, raising the question of whether this intriguing phenomenon might even exist for nearly indistinguishable particles. Here, we answer positively this physically motivated question by exploiting some mathematical conjecture on matrix permanents, whose physical interpretation had not yet been unveiled. Using a recently found counterexample to this conjecture, we demonstrate that there is an optical set-up involving 8~photons in 10~modes for which the probability that all photons bunch into two output modes can be enhanced by applying a suitable perturbation to the polarization states starting from photons with the same polarization. We also find out that the perturbation that decreases the bunching probability the most is not the one that takes the perfectly indistinguishable state towards a fully distinguishable state, as could naively be expected..</p>

SOQCS offers a framework to define, simulate and study quantum linear optical circuits in the presence of various imperfections.

SOQCS is developed as a series of different modules which provide quantum circuits, different simulator cores and tools to analyze the output. Quantum circuits can be defined from basic components, including emitters, linear optical elements, delays and detectors. Post-selection can be configured straightforwardly as part of detector definitions. An important attribute of SOQCS is its modularity which allows for its further development in the future..</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong>Reece D. Shaw, Alex E. Jones, Patrick Yard, Anthony Laing </p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The heralded generation of entangled states underpins many photonic quantum technologies. As quantum error correction thresholds are determined by underlying physical noise mechanisms, a detailed and faithful characterization of resource states is required. Non-computational leakage, e.g. more than one photon occupying a dual-rail encoded qubit, is an error not captured by standard forms of state tomography, which postselect on photons remaining in the computational subspace. Here we use the continuous-variable (CV) formalism and first quantized state representation to develop a simulation framework that reconstructs photonic quantum states in the presence of partial distinguishability and resulting non-computational leakage errors. Using these tools, we analyze a variety of Bell state generation circuits and find that the five photon discrete Fourier transform (DFT) Bell state generation scheme [Phys Rev. Lett. 126 23054 (2021)] is most robust to such errors for near-ideal photons. Through characterization of a photonic entangling gate, we demonstrate how leakage errors prevent a modular characterization of concatenated gates using current tomographical procedures. Our work is a necessary step in revealing the true noise models that must be addressed in fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing architectures..</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Javier Osca, Jiri Vala</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We are concerned with numerical simulations of quantum optical circuits under certain realistic conditions, specifically that photon quantum states are not perfectly indistinguishable. The partial photon distinguishability presents a serious limitation in implementation of optical quantum information processing. In order to properly assess its effect on quantum information protocols, accurate numerical simulations, which closely emulate quantum circuit operations, are essential. Our specific objective is to provide a computer implementation of the partial photon distinguishability which is in principle applicable to existing simulation techniques used for ideal quantum circuits and which avoids a need for their significant modification. Our approach is based on the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process, which is well suited for our purpose. Photonic quantum states are represented by wavepackets which contain information on their time and frequency distributions. In order to account for the partial photon distinguishability, we expand the number of degrees of freedom associated with the circuit operation extending the definition of the photon channels to incorporate wavepacket degrees of freedom. This strategy allows to define delay operations in the same footing as the linear optical elements..</p>

Most sampling schemes (such as Boson Sampling) are limited to completely indistinguishable particles; our work aids in the understanding of systems where an arbitrary level of distinguishability is permitted. As an application of our work we introduce a sampling scheme with partially-distinguishable fermions, which we call Generalized Fermion Sampling..</p>

            <h2>Boson bunching is not maximized by indistinguishable particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Benoît Seron, Leonardo Novo, Nicolas J. Cerf</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Boson bunching is amongst the most remarkable features of quantum physics. A celebrated example in optics is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where the bunching of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the trajectories where they both either cross a beam splitter or are reflected. This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons. Hence, it is generally admitted -- and experimentally verified -- that bunching vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, e.g., when they occupy distinct time bins or have different polarizations. Here we disproof this alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability and bunching by exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a family of optical circuits where the bunching of photons into two modes can be significantly boosted by making them partially distinguishable via an appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a 7-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon within reach of current photonic technology. This unexpected behavior questions our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between indistinguishable bosons and classical particles. </p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spin correlations of Λ-hyperons embedded in the QCD strings formed in high energy collider experiments provide unique insight into their locality and entanglement features. We show from general considerations that while the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality is less stringent for such states, they provide a benchmark for quantum-to-classical transitions induced by varying i) the associated hadron multiplicity, ii) the spin of nucleons, iii) the separation in rapidity between pairs, and iv) the kinematic regimes accessed. These studies also enable the extraction of quantitative measures of quantum entanglement. We first explore such questions within a simple model of a QCD string composed of singlets of two partial distinguishable fermion flavors and compare analytical results to those obtained on quantum hardware. We further discuss a class of spin Hamiltonians that model the dynamics of Λ spin correlations. Prospects for extracting quantum features of QCD strings from hyperon measurements at current and future colliders are outlined.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Junheng Shi, Tim Byrnes</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) allows for a way to demonstrate quantum supremacy with the relatively modest experimental resources of squeezed light sources, linear optics, and photon detection. In a realistic experimental setting, numerous effects can modify the complexity of the sampling, in particular loss, partial distinguishability of the photons, and the use of threshold detectors rather than photon counting detectors. In this paper, we investigate GBS with partial distinguishability using an approach based on virtual modes and indistinguishability efficiency. We develop a model using these concepts and derive the probabilities of measuring a specific output pattern from partially distinguishable and lossy GBS for both types of detectors. In the case of threshold detectors, the probability as calculated by the Torontonian is a special case under our framework. By analyzing the expressions of these probabilities we propose an efficient auxiliary classical simulation algorithm which can be used to calculate the probabilities. Our model and the auxiliary algorithm provide foundations for an approximation method for the probability calculation and simulation algorithms not only compatible with existing state-of-the-art simulation algorithms for ideal GBS but also reduce their complexities exponentially depending on the indistinguishability. Using the approximation method and the simulation algorithms we show how the boundary of quantum supremacy in GBS can be pushed further by partial distinguishability.</p>

            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Tommaso Favalli, Augusto Smerzi</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Time in quantum mechanics is peculiar: it is an observable that cannot be associated to an Hermitian operator. As a consequence it is impossible to explain dynamics in an isolated system without invoking an external classical clock, a fact that becomes particularly problematic in the context of quantum gravity. An unconventional solution was pioneered by Page and Wootters (PaW) in 1983. PaW showed that dynamics can be an emergent property of the entanglement between two subsystems of a static Universe. In this work we first investigate the possibility to introduce in this framework a Hermitian time operator complement of a clock Hamiltonian having an equally-spaced energy spectrum. An Hermitian operator complement of such Hamiltonian was introduced by Pegg in 1998, who named it "Age". We show here that Age, when introduced in the PaW context, can be interpreted as a proper Hermitian time operator conjugate to a "good" clock Hamiltonian. We therefore show that, still following Pegg's formalism, it is possible to introduce in the PaW framework bounded clock Hamiltonians with an unequally-spaced energy spectrum with rational energy ratios. In this case time is described by a POVM and we demonstrate that Pegg's POVM states provide a consistent dynamical evolution of the system even if they are not orthogonal, and therefore partially un-distinguishables.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the quantum to classical transition in Boson Sampling by analysing how N-boson interference is affected by inevitable noise in an experimental setup. We adopt the Gaussian noise model of Kalai and Kindler for Boson Sampling and show that it appears from some realistic experimental imperfections. We reveal a connection between noise in Boson Sampling and partial distinguishability of bosons, which allows us to prove efficient classical simulatability of noisy no-collision Boson Sampling with finite noise amplitude ϵ, i.e., ϵ=Ω(1) as N→∞. On the other hand, using an equivalent representation of network noise as losses of bosons compensated by random (dark) counts of detectors, it is proven that for noise amplitude inversely proportional to total number of bosons, i.e., ϵ=O(1/N), noisy no-collision Boson Sampling is as hard to simulate classically as in the noiseless case. Moreover, the ratio of ``noise clicks" (lost bosons compensated by dark counts) to the total number of bosons N vanishes as N→∞ for arbitrarily small noise amplitude, i.e., ϵ=o(1) as N→∞, hence, we conjecture that such a noisy Boson Sampling is also hard to simulate classically. The results significantly relax sufficient condition on noise in a network components, such as two-mode beam splitters, for classical hardness of experimental Boson Sampling.</p>

            <h2>Partial Distinguishability as a Coherence Resource in Boson Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Seungbeom Chin, Joonsuk Huh</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantum coherence is a useful resource that is consumed to
accomplish several tasks that classical devices are hard to fulfill. Especially, it is considered to be the origin of quantum speedup for many computational algorithms. In this work, we interpret the computational time cost of boson sampling with partially distinguishable photons from the perspective of coherence resource theory. With incoherent operations that preserve the diagonal elements of quantum states up to permutation, which we name \emph{permuted genuinely incoherent operation} (pGIO), we present some evidence that the decrease of coherence corresponds to a computationally less complex system of partially distinguishable boson sampling. Our result shows that coherence is one of crucial resources for the computational time cost of boson sampling. We expect our work presents an insight to understand the quantum complexity of the linear optical network system.</p>

            <h2>Totally Destructive Interference for Permutation-Symmetric Many-Particle States</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Christoph Dittel, Gabriel Dufour, Mattia Walschaers, Gregor Weihs, Andreas Buchleitner, Robert Keil</p>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>Several distinct classes of unitary mode transformations have been known to exhibit the strict suppression of a large set of transmission events, as a consequence of totally destructive many-particle interference. In another work [Dittel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 240404 (2018)] we unite these cases by identifying a general class of unitary matrices which exhibit such interferences. Here, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis that substantially expands on all aspects of this generalisation: We prove the suppression laws put forward in our other paper, establish how they interrelate with forbidden single-particle transitions, show how all suppression laws hitherto known can be retrieved from our general formalism, and discuss striking differences between bosons and fermions. Furthermore, beyond many-particle Fock states on input, we consider arbitrary pure initial states and derive suppression laws which stem from the wave function's permutation symmetry alone. Finally, we identify conditions for totally destructive interference to persist when the involved particles become partially distinguishable. </p>
